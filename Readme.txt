# MyCalendar

This application is intended to help the users manage their time in a more productive fashion, by easily condensing and showing relevant information throughout the day.

The main format of the application will contain a calendar view of the week showing relevant courses (or meetings) and then a daily view for more meticulous planning.


An input form will be provided for adding events (single time or reacccuring).
The application will require account creation and login, syncing the changes made to individual schedules to a database.

A system for adding friends and sharing your schedule with them or events will also be facilitated.
